Project Euler
=============

In the Spring 2011 semester a few of us Computer Science students became
overcome with a competitive spirit to one-up each other by solving as many
[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems as possible. We even created a
[leaderboard](http://cs.potsdam.edu/ACM/index.php/SUNY_Potsdam_ACM:Project_Euler_Leaderboard)
over at the [SUNY Postdam ACM wiki](http://cs.potsdam.edu/ACM) to keep track of
who was on top.

All of these solutions came before I had any regard for data structures, best
python practices, and efficiancy in general. Nevertheless, I present solutions
to the first 50 or so [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems.
